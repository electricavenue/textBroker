6171953;"Building your photography business";"Building Your Photography Business";"What you see is what you get.  Everybody has heard that one.  But when it comes to establishing and building your photography business truer words were probably never spoken.  Getting yourself and your work out amongst the public where potential clients can see your efforts is the best way to build your photography business.

When most people decide they want to build their business, they usually start talking about such tools as websites, blogs, social media outlets, forums and other electronic mediums.  In truth, that's a good start, but it's only a start, as well as a support start to boot.

For building your photography business there's no better way to do it than printed materials and personal contact.  If in the beginning you may decide that you need to enlist the help of a professional graphic artist, that's great, but pitching your services as a photographer will only be as good as your ability to show your work to the public. As a result, your work should be the main selling point of your pitch.

Sales, in most cases, is a numbers game.  In a very real sense the more people you reach with your sales message the greater your odds of reaching the contact who will purchase your services.  It only stands to reason that reaching the most prospective clients will eventually result in growing your business.

Reaching out to prospective clients can take many forms, from one on one contacts with business cards and brochures to meetings of social clubs and interest groups.  Another excellent choice is professional groups that could hire you, as individuals and as groups.  Associations of groups such as public relations practitioners, advertising executives, and media representatives are excellent sources of clients for photographers.

In the final analysis, just as is the case with any creative endeavor, it is the quality of your work that will cause your photography business to grow.  Toward this end any photographer wishing to grow their business should depend heavily on improving their work and expanding their offerings by taking classes from successful photographers who may present workshops and other classes.  Even if there is considerable time, effort and investment involved, they will pay for themselves in the long run."
6171957;"Photography portrait tips";"6 Photography Portrait Tips";"Portrait photography is both challenging and rewarding. Capturing a person's appearance in a flattering fashion is difficult enough, but the best portraits also have a sense of that person's character. Fortunately, even a novice can achieve great results with some basic photography portrait tips.

1. Prepare before the shoot.

Complete preparation can be a difficult habit to develop, but it is well worth the time and effort. This involves familiarity and efficiency with all the required camera gear and lighting equipment, a practice of having all necessary gear at hand, and gathering knowledge about both the subject and the shooting location. When the subject is at hand for the shoot, a photographer does not want to be focusing on gear or anything else.

2. Have emergency supplies handy.

For a portrait shoot on location, having emergency cosmetics and basic hair supplies can save the day. Baby wipes and basic first aid gear can also come in handy, as can insect repellent for outdoor shoots.

3. Have the subject prepare.

A comfortable, relaxed subject will provide the most natural-looking results in portrait photography, but flattering clothing is also helpful. Give subjects a list of guidelines and then allow them to choose what to wear. Sweaters with crew necks tend to be flattering, as do turtlenecks with long sleeves. Solid colors are preferable. Prominent jewelry should be avoided, and women should wear makeup that is understated and basic.

4. Stick with basic poses.

Have the subject straighten up, whether the pose is seated or standing. A seated subject should be placed on the seat's edge. Aim the subject's shoulders and head in the same direction, with the head tilted in the direction of the lower shoulder. Basic variations can be tried, but remember simplicity, especially when starting. Encourage smiles by smiling yourself and coaxing natural expressions with wry observations or jokes.

5. Avoid busy, distracting backgrounds.

Even with an outdoor shoot, portrait photography is about the subject, not about the setting. Ensure the focus remains on the subject by choosing backgrounds without too much distraction.

6. Determine the subject's problem areas and shoot accordingly.

Camera placement and lighting both depend on the best angle for each subject. For most headshots, having the <a href=""http://www.electricavenue.net/cameras-dslr-lenses"">lens</a> at the eye level of the subject is preferable. Subjects that are especially heavy benefit from a raised camera and a pose of looking up. Subjects with skin flaws such as scars should be positioned with the flawed side toward the light.
 
These tips can get a novice started with reliable successful portrait shots. With time, details such as lighting the eyes properly, familiarity with depth-of-field, and making use of complicated light and reflector systems will help even more in the quest for the perfect portrait."
6171961;"How to photograph cars";"How To Photograph Cars";"Perhaps you attended a car show, excited at the photo possibilities surrounding those shiny vehicles, but found that the results were disappointing. Photography often involves learning from your mistakes. It's much better to learn from other people's mistakes, however, and it's far less aggravating.

Arrive early. First, there are fewer people around to get in the way, and the owners are usually more talkative early in the day. If the show is outdoors, the light is often better, coming at an angle rather than directly overhead. Look at some car ads and you'll see that they're taken in the “golden hour” just after dawn or before sunset when the sun's light is more diffuse.

Don't discount shooting in the rain unless it's an absolute downpour. Close-up shots of raindrops beaded on glass, chrome, or highly-polished paint can be remarkable.

Set the camera <a href=""http://www.electricavenue.net/catalogsearch/result/?q=white+balance "">white balance</a> appropriately for the light you encounter. This yields more accurate colors, but learn to use a custom white balance for mixed lighting if the camera offers this feature. You'll need a white object as a reference, perhaps a card or even a handkerchief.

Your two best friends for excellent car photos are a circular polarizer and a tripod. The polarizer helps to eliminate reflections, often a problem with shiny surfaces, and it provides greater color saturation. Simply attach it to the front of the <a href=""http://www.electricavenue.net/cameras-dslr-lenses"">lens</a> and rotate it until the reflections disappear. A tripod is a necessity in dim light or when long exposures are indicated. It eliminates camera motion, a major cause of blurred photos.

Use camera angles to add some interest to your photos. Taking every shot from eye level can become bland and dull. Try some low angle shots to hide the background, placing the car against the sky. Or hold your camera overhead for a high angle shot. These techniques are simple if your camera has a tilting screen so you can compose more easily, but even if it doesn't tilt you can learn to do this with some practice.

Finally, learn to use some photo editing software. It won't save any truly bad shots, but it enhances the good ones. Most photos benefit from a slight increase in contrast, some color enhancement, and modest sharpening. You'll straighten horizons, remove blemishes, and much, much more as your skills improve."
6171965;"What lens should I buy";"What lens should I buy?";"The difficult task after buying a digital SLR or compact system camera is purchasing a <a href=""http://www.electricavenue.net/cameras-dslr-lenses"">lens</a>, which there are various types in the market. Thus, people ask themselves which <a href=""http://www.electricavenue.net/cameras-dslr-lenses"">lens</a> should I buy?

Types of Lenses

Prime or Fixed Focus

If mathematics defines a number itself as prime, then a single <a href=""http://www.electricavenue.net/cameras-dslr-lenses"">lens</a> has a similar definition. Prime lenses have a fixed focus. Thus, these lenses do not zoom, but function best in controlled lighting without zoom capability. Therefore, a prime <a href=""http://www.electricavenue.net/cameras-dslr-lenses"">lens</a> is beneficial in portrait photography. Also, prime lenses come in various focal lengths.

Standard Zoom

Standard zoom lenses can start from 18mm or 55mm to a maximum focal length of 250mm. Portrait and pet genres benefit from standard zoom lenses. Additionally, these lenses are useful in travel photography.

Telephoto Zoom

Similar to a standard zoom, a telephoto <a href=""http://www.electricavenue.net/cameras-dslr-lenses"">lens</a> provides a longer zoom range. These lenses have a maximum focal length ranging from 300mm to 400mm. Some telephoto lenses exceed the maximum focal length of 400mm. These lenses are best in sports, action and wildlife genres. However, the length of the lenses adds extra weight when attached to the camera body.

Wide-Angle

Starting at 24mm, these lenses add extra width to an image. Thus, wide-angle lenses provide a widescreen effect. These lenses are beneficial for landscape and group portraits.

Ultra-Wide Angle

Ultra-wide angle lenses have a shorter focal length than the standard wide-angle type. Most ultra-wide angle lenses do not exceed a focal length of 22mm. These lenses provide a wider image. Thus, landscape photography, including nature and city skylines, benefits most from these lenses. Also, these lenses are useful for group portraits.

Fish-eye

Since people are not fish, it is difficult to know how fishes see the world. A fish-eye <a href=""http://www.electricavenue.net/cameras-dslr-lenses"">lens</a> captures the subject with a 180 degree circular perspective. Travel and creative photographers use fish-eye lenses the most.

Macro

Macro lenses enhance the detail of close-up subjects. Hobby and nature photographers use these lenses the most. Macro lenses can show the edge of coins or magnify flowers. Tiny insects are common subjects of macro <a href=""http://www.electricavenue.net/cameras-dslr-lenses"">lens</a> users.

Overall, a <a href=""http://www.electricavenue.net/cameras-dslr-lenses"">lens</a> depends on the photographer's genre and purpose. Therefore, there is no one <a href=""http://www.electricavenue.net/cameras-dslr-lenses"">lens</a> that is perfect for all situations."
6171969;"High ISO shooting tips";"High ISO shooting tips";"The most important thing when shooting photos at high ISO is understand how ISO changes the quality of light and the grain of a photograph. The image captured by your <a href=""http://www.electricavenue.net/cameras-dslr-lenses"">lens</a> will not look the same as what you saw when you were snapping the picture. Colors often lose their brightness and the image will be noticeably grainy. What this means is that you may need to do more software manipulation on these photos if you need less noisy, more vibrant shots.

<strong>Balance</strong> Make sure you adjust your <a href=""http://www.electricavenue.net/catalogsearch/result/?q=white+balance"">white balance</a> for the venue where you are shooting. Though this won't get rid of the color differences entirely or eliminate the noise, it will help make the image a little truer to reality. 

<strong>Brighten</strong> Even though ISO is technically for low light situations, if you can use a flash, you may find that it helps in keeping the main focal point from being as noisy as it would be without the flash. This can also be achieved by allowing a slower shutter speed for a longer, brighter exposure, though this is tricky to get right.

<strong>Continuous Shutter</strong> Whether you have a low end SLR or <a href=""http://www.electricavenue.net/catalogsearch/result/?q=gopro"">GoPro</a> equipment, one of the best things about the digital age of photography is being free of the limits and expenses of film. Why have the ability to fill a memory card with 1000 shots, if you aren't going to use it? ISO is the perfect opportunity to use continuous mode, if your camera has it. The more pictures you take of the action, the more likely you are to freeze something magical.

<strong>Practice and Play</strong> Before the event you need to photograph, take your camera and a friend and play around with various ISO settings, shutter speeds and lighting techniques. Find out just what your camera can do and how well it does it at different settings. Try the same basic photo with altered settings, like using RAW instead of JPEG or setting the ISO to auto instead of manually changing it. Find the sweet spot between not sharp enough and too grainy. 

Then take the results and practice working them around with software to get the best images you can from them. Try converting grainy pics to monochrome or black and white. Try lowering the saturation except focal points. See just what works and what doesn't."
6171973;"Time lapse with a GoPro Hero";"Time lapse with a GoPro Hero";"Time lapse photography refers to the process of placing a camera in a fixed location and taking a series of photos at set intervals over a range of minutes, hours or even days. The photos are then ""played back"" like a movie. Time lapse has so many applications, ranging from education to entertainment. It can be used to show the full life cycle of a plant or the metamorphosis of an insect in only a few seconds. Hours long construction projects can be shown in minutes. They can be used for security purposes or to monitor traffic in a given location

In order to get the best time lapse set up from <a href=""http://www.electricavenue.net/catalogsearch/result/?q=gopro"">GoPro</a>, you have to start with the right camera. The <a href=""http://www.electricavenue.net/catalogsearch/result/?q=gopro"">GoPro</a> HERO3 Black Edition is an excellent choice, offering versatility, durability and dependability. Since it is waterproof and has built-in Wi-Fi, there are very few jobs for which this camera <i>wouldn't</i> be the right choice. It even comes with mounting hardware. If the Black Edition is outside your price range, the HERO3 also comes in a White or a Silver edition. 

In addition to the camera itself, there are a few other items you might need for a time lapse shoot. Part of what you will need depends on whether you will be shooting the scene from straight on, from above or from another angle. If you plan to shoot from above, you will need to have hardware to secure the camera in the air. 

Another factor in which extra accessories you might need is how long your shoot will last. If it will be lengthy, you need at minimum a <a href=""http://www.electricavenue.net/catalogsearch/result/?q=gopro"">GoPro</a> Battery BacPac™. This handy backup plugs right into the rear of the camera, comes with an extended door for the waterproof case and will give you about twice as long to shoot before battery failure. If that time frame still isn't long enough, a wall outlet or portable battery charger is another option. If you decide to go with the latter, a small equipment bag will keep everything together and looking professional. <a href=""http://www.electricavenue.net/catalogsearch/result/?q=gopro"">GoPro</a> offers a drawstring variety in multi-packs that might be perfect for this.

With the right equipment, time lapse shoots are easy to set up. While cameras and accessories for this type of photography is not inexpensive, the results are well worth the cost, especially since most time lapse has professional applications."
6171977;"Workflow for professional photographers";"Workflow for professional photographers";"Most professional photographers work under deadlines.  To achieve a more efficient workflow, a professional photographer begins by preparing mentally and physically for any photo shoot.

Before the Photo Shoot
To prepare for a photo shoot, photographers will consider what the subject, lighting and final-product expectations are.  These considerations will then dictate what equipment is selected for the particular assignment.  For example, daytime sporting events that are being photographer for a newspaper article have different equipment needs than a wedding reception.  Photographers will choose lens focal lengths and equipment for managing light as necessary.  

An extremely important preparation is to also develop a shot list, which is a brief list describing specific pictures one will acquire in addition to the spontaneous ones a photographer captures while at the photo shoot.  The shot list will be based on the assignment’s deliverables, which are the pictures the customer is most likely requiring for the final use.  For example, a picture of the newlyweds’ first dance is a common deliverable from wedding-reception assignments.

Shooting for Perfection
Photo editing software is very powerful, and many technical errors can be fixed in post production.  Professional photographers, however, do not necessarily have the time to spend fixing photos in post.  This is why professional photographers always attempt to capture perfectly exposed and composed images in-camera.  This becomes especially important when closely scheduled photo shoots are likely to produce hundreds of photos each.  A professional can improve their workflow by making sure every exposure captured is properly framed and exposed because this allows them to use their valuable post-production time for sorting images based solely on content.

Meet Deadlines and Expectations
Given enough time and practice, most people can produce great photos.  That is why a professional sets themselves apart from the amateur class by delivering the highest quality photographs in the shortest amount of time.  This achievement is completely dependent on one's workflow efficiency.

Summary
Begin by being mentally prepared to capture the images that will be most descriptive of the event.  Make sure all of the equipment is ready for the shoot by ensuring batteries are fully charged and everything is in proper working order.  Fulfill the shooting list demands in conjunction with capturing unexpected gems from the event.  Shoot proficiently so no time is wasted in post production correcting problems that could have been avoided with proper exposure and framing.  Deliver all photographs to customers on-time."
6171981;"How to work with children and photography";"How to Work With Children and Photography";"A child’s natural joy and energy can translate into timeless, expressive photographs full of movement and emotion. However, photographing children is an art form and one much more difficult to master than photographing teens and adults. Children have a natural curiosity and are easily distracted. They have a limited understanding that can make verbal direction difficult. Technical know-how and some basic behavioral suggestions can help make photographing children a fun, memorable event that captures and preserves their all-too-fleeting childhoods in timeless, portrait-quality images. 

<b>Lenses and Camera Settings</b>
Wide-angle lenses are not ideal for portraiture simply because they have a tendency to distort the image. A 35 to 50 mm <a href=""http://www.electricavenue.net/cameras-dslr-lenses"">lens</a> is ideal for taking three-quarter and full length shots where a focused background is desired. A longer <a href=""http://www.electricavenue.net/cameras-dslr-lenses"">lens</a> positioned farther away from the child produces a shallower field depth that blurs the background and makes the child the clear focal point. Most digital cameras nowadays offer multiple settings for different types of photographs. Using the portrait setting allows the photographer to zero in on the subject using a wide aperture. This feature is designed to blur the background which is a technique that emphasizes the child’s expression. Sneaking up on children when they are engaged in an activity is one of many tried and true techniques a photographer can use to capture portrait-quality images. For this technique, a sports setting with a high ISO and fast shutter speed is ideal. 

<b>Shooting Techniques</b>
Stoop or kneel to the child’s level to avoid shadows and strange distortions. Consider lying on the ground and shooting up in order to capture the child in the brightest light. Vary focal distances as well as the width and depth of shots. Spontaneity is the key to timeless photographs of a child. Capture live-action shots of children playing, running or making a mess. Children don’t like to sit in one spot for too long and too much direction can confuses and upset a child. Whenever possible, natural lighting is best. Turn off your flash and shoot indoor images closer to a window. Avoid shooting outdoor images during the noon hours as this will create harsh contrasts and shadows around the eye sockets. Also avoid positioning the child with their face towards the sun or you will end up with strange shadows, harsh highlights and a squinting child. If studio lighting is necessary keep the ratios between 2 or 3.5 to 1. Anything higher will increase the image contrast and narrow the face of the child."
6171985;"Best practices to get more online exposure with your Photographs";"Best Practices to Get More Online Exposure With Your Photographs";"The Internet is a great place for up and coming photographers to get exposure for their work. Knowing where to start, though, can be a difficult task. Here are some good tips to help you as a photographer can get more online exposure.

1. Create an online portfolio. You can use Facebook pages, traditional websites, or online photography site options such as Flickr, but get yourself someplace you could put on a business card for somebody to browse. If somebody finds one of your photos, they should be able to easily find you and see your other work.

2. Write short stories about your photos. People love to hear behind-the-scenes stories or to know why a particular shot is important to you. It makes the photo more personal and easy to connect to. If you're primarily a photographer of people, share their bio or the experience you had taking pictures of them. If you photograph events, write a little bit about the experience. If you do more art-focused, less subject-focused work, then write about what captured you in the scene you've photographed.

3. Update often. If you have a lot of old photos to upload, feel free to do a chunk at a time. That way, visitors to the website will be encouraged to return often to see what you're up to. You definitely don't want a website that has thousands of photos uploaded in one day and then nothing for three months.

4. Use social media to market your portfolio. If you have a traditional website, create a Facebook and Twitter page for your business and ask those who follow your personal profile to follow those as well. This allows you to share your work easily and connect directly with potential clients or publishers who may be interested in using your work but want to know a little bit more about you before making a decision.

5. Enter online photo contests. Offline photo contests are great as well, but online ones specifically help to increase your online exposure. If someone searches for your photography business online and finds all the awards you've won, that reflects very well in your favor. You may also get a chance to meet and network with other photographers in the same line of work. If you work with them, you can help promote each other's work and continue to expand your circle of influence."
6171989;"Photographic White Balance";"Photographic White Balance";"Every photographer has snapped an amazing shot only to find it carries the wrong color cast. The cause is a basic error in photographic <a href=""http://www.electricavenue.net/catalogsearch/result/?q=white+balance "">white balance</a>. By mastering this simple tool, you can capture true-to-life color every time.

What Is White Balance?
Every lighting situation has a ""temperature,"" a naturally warm or cool cast. Even the sun produces different color temperatures throughout the day. If you step outside just before sunrise, everything will look blue. At sunset, everything will seem gold and orange. Adjusting a photo's <a href=""http://www.electricavenue.net/catalogsearch/result/?q=white+balance "">white balance</a> counteracts the color cast to produce more lifelike tones.

What Are The Options?
Auto White Balance (AWB) is imperfect at best. Most digital cameras have five standard white balance options in addition to AWB: tungsten, fluorescent, daylight, flash, cloudy, and shade. The temperature of the lighting situation they are used in is expressed in ""Kelvin,"" or ""K.""

""Tungsten,"" 2500-3500 K, is meant to be used with standard, incandescent bulbs. Incandescent light is warm, and so the Tungsten setting will cool down your photos.

""Fluorescent,"" 4000-5000 K, is designed to warm up photos taken under the usually cool light of fluorescent tubes.

""Flash,"" 5000-5500 K, counteracts the slight cool tone given off by flash bulbs.

""Daylight,"" 5000-6500 K, is for overhead sun in clear conditions.

""Cloudy,"" 6500-8000 K, gives a modest warm cast to outdoor shots. Many photographers use it as an all-purpose outdoor setting.

""Shade,"" 9000-10000 K, adds quite a bit of warmth to photos. It is a good all-purpose setting for low-light conditions when you are not using flash.

The Custom setting will allow you to choose your own Kelvin range. It is excellent when you know exactly what you need you need or need something in-between two presets.

Post-Processing
If you set your camera capture a RAW image any time you take a photo, you can make easy custom adjustments on the computer in post-processing. You can then use a gray card to customize <a href=""http://www.electricavenue.net/catalogsearch/result/?q=white+balance"">white balance</a>.

Gray cards are exactly what they sound like. You take a photo of a gray-colored card in your lighting conditions. Then, in image editing software, you sample the gray card using the <a href=""http://www.electricavenue.net/catalogsearch/result/?q=white+balance"">White Balance</a> tool. The program will automatically give you an ideal white balance for you to tweak.

With a little knowledge and experimentation, you can master <a href=""http://www.electricavenue.net/catalogsearch/result/?q=white+balance"">white balance</a> quickly. Your photos will look more professional, lifelike and beautiful for it."
6171993;"What is the difference between master-enabled and master-disabled";"What is the difference between master-enabled and master-disabled?";"Photographers new to remote flashes are bound to come across master flash settings, but their use can be confusing since the master seems to fire regardless of whether the master is enabled or disabled. What's the difference, and how does this affect the final photo?


What is the difference between master-enabled and master-disabled?

The master is the flash attached directly to the camera, whether it's built into the case or attached to the hot shoe. The slaves are the remote flashes.

If the camera is set to ""Master-enabled,"" the on-camera flash and the remote flashes will both fire when the shutter opens.

If the camera is set to ""Master-disabled,"" the remote flashes will fire when the shutter opens, but not the master flash.

Speedlights are activated by infrared or visible light sensors, so even when the the master is disabled, it will still flash just before the shutter opens to trigger the speedlights. This is why changing the setting doesn't appear to change the operation of the lights.


How can I tell which setting I'm using?

This setting is symbolized by an old angle-adjustable flash representing the master with a Z-shaped arrow below and to the left representing the remote signal. If there are lines coming out of the flash symbol, the camera is set to ""Master-enabled.""


Which setting should I use?

Although remote flashes are in use, the master flash can still play a role in lighting. 

Using on-camera flash will act as a fill flash, removing the shadows from the subject. Master-enabled allows this additional light to be used. If shadows are desired, the camera should be set to master-disabled.

Although it fires just before the shutter opens, the remote-triggering flash may cause the master to be bright enough when the shutter opens to act as a fill flash, especially if the camera is close to the subject. Pointing the flash away from the subject will stop this fill effect while still triggering the speedlights.

A master flash doesn't necessarily have to be on-camera: It's possible to connect a flash at some distance by linking it to the hot shoe via a long TTL hot shoe cord. Since this allows the master to be located anywhere, this eliminates the fill flash problem of an on-camera flash. 


Why aren't my remotes firing when they should?

Using red eye reduction or E-TTL will cause a flash before the shutter opens, which may trigger the optical sensors on speedlights prematurely. Make sure both features are turned off before taking the photo."

6473565;"Samsung Galaxy S4";"The Samsung Galaxy S4 Has Arrived";"The moment has arrived. Samsung has unveiled its new Galaxy S4 smart phone. If you're looking for bells and whistles, this phone has plenty. It's like a mini-computer you can put in your pocket, with more capabilities than a phone has a right to have. You might want to sit down for this.

The Galaxy S4 comes with 16, 32, and 64gb internal storage capacity and a generous 5"" full HD screen in a sleek design. If that's not enough storage for you, it also comes with a microSD slot for up to 64gb of additional storage. You'd be hard-pressed to fill this baby up anytime soon.

The Galaxy S4 has a rear-facing 13-megapixel camera and a 2-megapixal front-facing camera. Now you can leave that bulky camera at home and take some stunning photos in a flash. And speaking of flash, it has that too, plus many other features such as panoramic, burst mode, and digital zoom. 

But wait, there's more. You can print from your Galaxy S4 phone too. Print from your phone to any 180 HP printer from the same wi-fi network. No setup is required. Or you can use a direct wireless link between devices with selected printer models. Now you don't have to email yourself something to print from your home or office computer. 

Imagine watching a video on your phone and finding yourself distracted by a passer-by. With the Smart Pause feature, your video will stop when your eyes are averted from the screen. Never miss the best part of your videos again, or the worst.

Also included on the Galaxy S4 are the Samsung Hub, rival to the Google Play store, the S Health feature to monitor heart rate and blood pressure, even blood sugar, and the S Translator for speech-to-text and vice versa translation in nine languages.

Here are some of the less thrilling, but equally important technical specs of the phone:

• Bluetooth 4

• NFC

• GPS

• 3G and 4G

• 2gb of ram

• Dual-band 802.11abgn/ac Wi-Fi

• The latest Android operating system, Android 4.2.2 (Jelly Bean)

With these features, the Galaxy S4 system is one smooth operator, even if you're not.

These and many more features make the Samsung Galaxy S4 a force to be reckoned with. It's a powerful multipurpose device all tucked into a compact package. There's no news yet on whether it can make sandwiches, but don't be surprised if it does."

The state of the art lens also features Extra Refractive (XR) Index Glass technology giving it a shorter lens length, subsequently allowing it to come in as the lightest and most compact fast zoom lens at 508 grams. This unique feature does not compromise the F/2.8's outstanding imaging performance. XR glass's unique and delightfully exceptional light bending capabilities allows short barrel lenses to maintain the same aperture value as longer barrel lenses. 

Despite being described as a digital lens, the lens also has full 35mm coverage allowing for applications from landscape to photojournalism. A neat addition to the feature list of the lens is the protective ZL (Zoom Lock) functionality. Perfect for travelers, this feature prevents the lens from overextending during transport of your camera and its accessories.

The Distagon T* 35mm f/2.0 follows in the footsteps of its predecessors in the Zeiss line by providing superior image quality over the entire spectrum of aperture speeds and focal points. The f/2.0 aperture enables superior photography and videography under the most demanding lighting situations and the ability to acquire the razor thin depth of field that is often called for. If pairing with an ASP-C DSLR (Canon 60 D, T4i, etc.) the focal length will equate to 53mm making this useful as a lens for the natural eye focal length of 50mm, making this a lens that is valuable to those shooting on full-frame cameras or otherwise. This lens is fitted for the Nikon F Mount.

The ZF.2 lenses are the next step in the evolution of ZF lenses. ZF.2 lenses such as this one sport an electronic interface that makes all the most essential camera modes usable, including: shutter priority mode, aperture priority mode, etc. Essential indicators such as focal length, speed and aperture settings are now transmitted directly to the camera, lessening the load for photographers who once had to set such parameters manually.

This lens provides the optical superiority of contrast, color rendition and sharpness that the Zeiss brand has become world renown for. Zeiss lenses sport an all-metal construction suited for years of professional wear and tear. Weighting in at 1.17 lbs. this lens is not for the fait of heart. Zeiss ZF.2 lenses feature a uniform color characteristic between focal lengths with all other ZF.2 lenses and even the older ZE lenses, making lens changes less of a cautious proposition and decreasing the lag between finding the same “feel” for the shot once you’ve changed lenses.

The Nikon F Mount allows for versatile application through the use of third party adaptors and compatibility with an already impressive roster of modern and retro Nikon cameras sporting the F mount.

I had wanted a camera forever because I really want to be a reporter when I grow up. I think taking pictures will help me with that. My dad always said that cameras were too expensive for kids to play with, but he told me that he thought I was responsible enough now that I was 11. He also told me that I could use it for a school project I had coming up. In the project I had to go to a local business and tell my class what I thought of it. I decided to visit the new zoo in my town because I'd never been there before and I knew there would be tons of cool things to take pictures of.  
 
My dad took me to the zoo and I was so excited! I could tell my camera was really expensive because it had a huge lens that let me take close up pictures of all the animals. My dad also got me a flash memory drive to go with the camera, so it could hold tons of pictures. Since I didn't have to worry about running out of space, I took photos of everything. I even took pictures of the lunch we ate. 
 
My favorite part of the whole day was when I got to see the baby tiger though. The zoo keepers were feeding him with a bottle and they even let me hold it! My dad took a picture of it and I couldn't wait to show my classmates. I just knew that my presentation was going to be the best in the whole class. 
 
It was almost time to go home when something terrible happened. Me and my dad went to see the giraffes and we learned we could feed them. You had to climb up lots of stairs to reach their heads. My dad told me to be careful with my camera, but I was so excited about feeding the giraffes that I wasn't being responsible. Just as we reached the top of the stairs, the camera slipped out of my hands and feel all the way down to the ground. The lens broke right off and the camera cracked into a bunch of pieces. I was ready to cry. I thought for sure I was going to fail my project and my dad would hate me. 
 
My dad must have known how sad I was though, because he told me it was okay. He was even able to get the pictures off the camera thanks to the flash memory drive. I got an A on my presentation, and if I ever get a new camera, I'll be much more careful with it."
