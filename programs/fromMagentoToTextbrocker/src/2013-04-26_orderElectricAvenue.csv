Long Description:
<p><strong>Sony</strong>&nbsp;continues to raise the bar with the introduction of its rain- and dust-proof&nbsp;<strong>HXR-NX70U NXCAM Compact Camcorder</strong>. This rugged little trouper is the perfect companion for those tough location shoots where weather and climate cause lesser cameras to buckle and fold. Meeting stringent dustproof and rainproof requirements, the NX70U's sealed body keeps out all but the toughest of elements, making it ideal for documentary and news videographers traveling to far-flung, unpredictable locations.<br /><br />But beneath the NX70U's weatherproofing is a first-class performer that hits all the professional sweet spots. Its back-illuminated Exmor R CMOS sensor combines with an ultra wide 26.3-263mm Sony G lens and Optical SteadyShot to provide outstanding full HD 1080p images even in low light. The Dual Rec function, meanwhile, lets you shoot 12.3MP stills while recording video, all of which can be captured to the unit's spacious 96GB embedded flash memory or your choice of Memory Stick or SD/SDHC media.<br /><br />And just because the NX70U is small doesn't mean it stints on professional features and controls. An assignable lens ring gives you manual control over focus, zoom, or iris, while the detachable handle with dual XLR inputs--and an on-camera shotgun mic--provides the option of recording 2-channel audio using high-end external microphones. Helping you nail focus and exposure are the zebra and peaking indicators, which can be viewed through either the large viewfinder or high-resolution 3.5"" touchscreen LCD.<br /><br />Documentarians in particular will find the built-in GPS receiver useful, as it allows you to ""tag"" your locations for logging and future reference, with all GPS data extractable to a PC and mappable via Google's mapping service. And if achieving a more cinematic look is your thing, then the camera offers 24p recording to supplement its standard 60p, along with CinemaTone technology to provide realistic, film-like skin tones to your footage.<br /><br />So step outside, grit your teeth against the rain and sand, and hit Record: the NX70U will capture the scene and live to tell the tale.</p>
<div class=""sectionHeaders""><dl><dt>Rain- and Dust-Proof Performance</dt><dd>You can be confident rainy or dusty shooting environments will not affect the reliable operation of the HXR-NX70 thanks to its IEC60529 IP54 rating. The camcorder's sealed body design makes sure that harmful sand and large dust particles do not get inside.<br /><br />A waterproof performance rating of IPx4 means that the main camera body is protected against rain showers and water splashes. However, it should not be submerged underwater or sprayed with pressurized water from a tap or hose. When used with accessories such as an external microphone, a rain cover should be used to protect the accessory and connection. IP5x rating does not guarantee 100% protection against exposure to extremely fine particles.</dd></dl><dl><dt>Ultra Wide Angle 26.3mm G lens</dt><dd>Engineered for superior optical performance, Sony G lenses deliver brilliant, accurate color reproduction and sharp, amazingly detailed images. In addition, the 26.3mm focal length offers a broader perspective than previous lenses for enhanced wide angle shooting so you can capture more of the scene when close in.</dd></dl><dl><dt>Assignable Lens Ring (Focus/Zoom/Iris)</dt><dd>Get the most out of your camcorder with enhanced manual controls. The assignable lens ring allows for manual adjustment of focus, iris, and zoom settings so you have complete creative control.</dd></dl><dl><dt>Optical SteadyShot Image Stabilization with Active Mode</dt><dd>Optical SteadyShot image stabilization with Active Mode provides superior compensation for camera shake to deliver stunningly smooth video from wide angle to full telephoto shooting. In addition, the innovative 3-Way Shake-Canceling feature adds electronic roll stability for even smoother video capture.</dd></dl><dl><dt>Back-Illuminated Exmor R CMOS Sensor</dt><dd>Journalists rarely shoot under studio lighting conditions and Sony's back-illuminated Exmor R CMOS sensor delivers stunning lowlight sensitivity with improved image clarity and drastically reduced grain. Designed for compact cameras and camcorders, the Exmor R sensor relocates the photo diodes above the support circuitry, maximizing the light-gathering area per pixel so you can shoot with better results in lowlight conditions. The sensitivity is roughly double that of conventional CMOS sensors of the same size and pixel size.</dd></dl><dl><dt>1920 x 1080 Full HD 60/24p Recording &amp; 12.3MP Still Images</dt><dd>The compact HXR-NX70 shoots in full high-definition quality (1920 x 1080) with a choice of 60p, 60i and 24p frame rates. It can also simultaneously shoot 12.3-megapixel (4672 x 2628) still images. It also supports playback via HDMI and compatible HDTV, for complete flexibility in reviewing your footage.</dd></dl><dl><dt>96GB Embedded Flash Memory for Up to 40 hours of HD Recording</dt><dd>Built-in flash memory provides extra capacity, ideal when working remotely, as well as providing additional workflow options for backup and sharing content. 96GB embedded flash memory can record and store up to 40 hours of high definition video footage in HD LP mode.</dd></dl><dl><dt>3.5"" Touchscreen XtraFine LCD display (921K)</dt><dd>The large 3.5"" (16:9) XtraFine LCD screen (921K) displays sharp, bright, vivid images, letting you compose a shot more easily and alter settings to best represent the scene, even when outdoors in bright lighting conditions.</dd></dl><dl><dt>XLR Adapter with Selectable Phantom Power + Shotgun Mic</dt><dd>The detachable handle has a compact, ergonomic design. Two balanced XLR audio inputs are built in with phantom power and attenuation options that professional shooters require for clean sound quality. Default audio settings for XLR recording are highlighted in green for easy reference in the field in order to reduce operator error under difficult lighting conditions.
<p>The ECM-XM1 shotgun microphone mounted on top of the handle provides audio recording performance similar to larger shoulder-mounted ENG style cameras.</p>
</dd></dl><dl><dt>Geotagging with Built-in GPS Receiver</dt><dd>A built-in GPS receiver makes the HXR-NX70 an ideal choice for professional videographers. The receiver gives you the ability to ""geo-tag"" shooting locations--making it easy if you need to return to the same location or create a log when surveying remote locations. Your locations can be tracked on Google maps and all GPS data can be extracted with a PC.
<p>Additionally, the receiver automatically adjusts your camcorder's clock to the proper time zone when international travel is part of your assignment.</p>
</dd></dl><dl><dt>Direct Copy to External HDD without PC</dt><dd>Store content or back up important shots by copying footage directly from your camcorder to an external hard disk drive (sold separately) without using a computer. The HXR-NX70 can also access videos stored on an external hard drive for playback on HDTV, allowing you to utilize the camcorder's handy playback features.<br /><br /><em>Note: Direct Copy is compatible with USB media that meets the following requirements: USB 2.0 or higher and formatted in FAT32 file system. It is recommended that external HDD is AC powered. The HXR-NX70 must be connected to AC power when using Direct Copy. VMC-UAM1 cable is supplied to connect HXR-NX70 with USB media, however connection via USB hub is not supported. There may be cases when USB media is not compatible with the Direct Copy function.</em></dd></dl></div>

<p>The<strong>Sony NEX-VG30 Camcorder with 18-200mm f/3.5-6.3 Power Zoom Lens</strong>is an interchangeable lens camera for cinematic video and DSLR quality photographs, featuring a 16.1MP Exmor APS-C sized CMOS sensor, an XGA OLED Tru-Finder EVF, a Quad Capsule Spatial Array Microphone, a BIONZ image processor and the Sony E-mount for Sony E-Mount lenses. NEX-VG30 presents a significant upgrade from Sony's NEX-VG20, adding a seesaw lever for power zoom, a Multi Interface shoe, a much improved electronic viewfinder, Picture Effects and the option for an external XLR adapter<em>(sold separately)</em>.</p>
<div class=""sectionHeaders""><dl><dt>18-200mm f/3.5-6.3 Power Zoom Lens</dt><dd>Sony's 18-200mm f/3.5-6.3 Power Zoom lens features silent auto-focus, optical image stabilization and an 11x zoom ratio. Used in conjunction with the VG30's APS-C sized sensor the 35mm equivalent angle-of-view will be 27mm on the wide end and 300mm on the long end of the zoom range.

When it comes to film-like video there is simply no substitute for sensor size.</dd></dl><dl><dt>Direct Power Zoom with Variable Speed</dt><dd>The NEX-VG30 was built with a powered zoom seesaw lever, which will operate the new 18-200mm f/3.5-6.3 Power Zoom Lens and, when used in conjunction with manual zooms or even prime lenses, it will facilitate a 2x digital zoom.</dd></dl><dl><dt>XGA OLED Tru-Finder EVF with Eye Sensor</dt><dd>The Tru-Finder OLED electronic viewfinder features 2,359,000 dot resolution and a high contrast ratio. The EVF allows you to see the results of camera adjustments in real time with superb color and detail. It exhibits excellent handling of motion blur and, in extremely light or dark environments, it presents a distinct advantage over other monitoring options.</dd></dl><dl><dt>Quad Capsule Spatial Array Microphone</dt><dd>A carry over from earlier VG series camcorders, this is not your average built-in microphone. The Quad Capsule Spatial Array stereo microphone contains four precision placed microphone capsules that are angled at 45 degrees to provide exceptional front-side directivity and stereo separation.</dd></dl><dl><dt>Microphone Jack with Audio Level Control</dt><dd>A 3.5mm audio input jack provides an interface for external microphones, such as shotgun microphone ECM-CG50<em>(sold separately)</em>, and audio level controls facilitate clean recordings in excessively loud or quiet environments. Additionally, Sony's XLR Adapter and Microphone Kit<em>(XLR-K1M sold separately)</em>can provide a microphone, two XLR inputs, audio control dials and a shock mount. A dedicated headphone jack aids users in monitoring sound.</dd></dl><dl><dt>Vegas Movie Studio Platinum 12</dt><dd>Included free of charge via download, Sony Vegas Movie Studio HD Platinum 12 allow you to add video effects, background music, titles, text, transitions, and more. Share your creations via DVD and Blu-ray Disc or upload videos to the web, all from one easy to use program. Vegas Movie Studio Platinum 12 features up to 20 tracks, 64-bit power, 20 Sony Sound Series Music Tracks and interface enhancements.</dd></dl><dl><dt>High Resolution RAW and JPEG Stills</dt><dd>NEX-VG30 also shoots DSLR-quality, 16.1MP RAW and JPEG format still photographs. A continuous burst mode captures photos at up to 6 frames per second.</dd></dl><dl><dt>Sony E-Mount Lenses</dt><dd>NEX-VG30 features the Sony E-Mount, which enables the ever expanding line of Sony E-Mount lenses. What is more, the E-Mount's short focal flange distance of 18mm makes it compatible with a wide range of lens adapters. For instance, using the LA-EA2 adaptor<em>(sold separately)</em>you can attach the full selection of A-Mount lenses, which includes current Sony models and dozens of Minolta legacy lenses.</dd></dl><dl><dt>Comprehensive Manual Controls</dt><dd>Aperture priority, shutter speed priority or manual exposure control can all be accessed while shooting video via a control dial or easy-access buttons. With extensive manual control of Iris, you will be able to adapt to almost any lighting condition to get the best shot.</dd></dl><dl><dt>CinemaTone Presets and 24p</dt><dd>For extra control over image expression, CinemaTone technology is used to recreate film-like color tones. 24p recording represents a concept established by the motion picture industry's standard of 24 frames per second. Recording in this mode renders motion with a more film-like look than the NTSC video standard 30p.</dd></dl><dl><dt>Advanced controls</dt><dd>The NEX-VG30 provides advanced capture and control features that are often considered the domain of professional cameras including expanded focus for precise manual focus control, zebra and peaking for precision focus and exposure adjustments.</dd></dl><dl><dt>Flash Media Slot</dt><dd>For capturing and sharing videos and photographs, the media card slot accepts Memory Stick Duo, Memory Stick PRO Duo, Memory Stick PRO-HG Duo and SD/SDHC/SDXC memory cards.</dd></dl><dl><dt>Multi-Interface Shoe</dt><dd>Unlike conventional camcorders, the NEX-VG30 also features a newly developed Multi-Interface Shoe that expands compatibility with Handycam accessories. Attach an optional XLR adapter<em>(sold separately)</em>to the Multi-Interface shoe to enable the highest quality external microphones.</dd></dl><dl><dt>Picture Effects</dt><dd>Picture Effects add a new level of expression to photos and video, lending ordinary images and scenes a distinctive look by emphasizing certain attributes. Posterization, Pop Photo, Partial Color, High contrast Monochrome and Toy Camera are available for stills and video. Additional effects, Focus and Miniature, are reserved for stills mode.</dd></dl><dl><dt>Anti-Dust Technology</dt><dd>Anti-Dust Technology helps keep the CMOS sensor clean, resulting in consistently clear pictures. First a static-free coating on the sensor's low-pass filter helps repel dust. Then vibration automatically dislodges dust from the sensor.</dd></dl></div>

Long Description:
<p><strong>Sony</strong>'s<strong>Alpha NEX-7 Digital Camera with 18-55mm Lens</strong>is an extremely high 24.3Mp resolution camera with the aforementioned lens included. You can start shooting from day one with this combo, the 18-55mm lens of course being just one of the numerous lens options you have for this Sony E-Mount compatible camera. Non-Sony lenses are compatible with the camera as well using an optional adapter.</p>
<p>Known for their compact size, versatility, and interchangeable lens feature Sony's NEX cameras are a digital revolution in the photo world. You can shoot creatively without being worn down by a heavy DSLR rig. In addition, you can also capture 1920 x 1080p HD video, another hallmark of the genre. No matter what you're shooting however, video or stills, the camera's APS-C sensor and the BIONZ image processor work together to help create rich, clear, and incredibly detailed results.</p>
<p>The NEX-7 also features the Tru-Finder OLED electronic viewfinder. This eye-level finder gives you that same old-school feeling<em>and</em>all the benefits of shooting through a viewfinder - less glare and distraction. The OLED also lets you see the results of adjustments in real time as well. Of course, the camera also sports a tiltable 3.0"" Xtra Fine LCD screen. The LCD features Sony's TruBlack screen which suppresses internal reflections.</p>
<p>Expanding the tools in your arsenal for the NEX-7 would be the built-in pop-up flash. Take clean, blur-free photos even in low-light situations. The camera also accepts other Sony Alpha system flashes and flash accessories thanks to the hot shoe.</p>
<p>The many shooting functions and modes of the NEX-7 give you the means to express your creativity in numerous ways as well. While the many interchangeable lens options provide a major advantage, features like Sweep Panorama, 3D Sweep Panorama, and Object Tracking help make taking great photos a breeze. And Auto HDR improves your photos by combining highlight and shadow detail from multiple shots for the best possible contrast and detail. Additionally, like those big DSLR's the NEX-7 also puts Program, Aperture, Priority, Shutter Priority, and Manual functions at your fingertips, along with many other creative options.</p>

Sony 18-200mm f/3.5-6.3 OSS E-mount NEX Series Camera Lens (Silver)

Short Description:
<ul class=""liststyle-bullets"">
<li><strong>Internal Focusing System :</strong>Internal lens elements move when focusing, so the overall length does not change -- creating a lens that focuses more quickly and doesn't change balance.</li>
<li><strong>Circular Aperture :</strong>Because aperture blades form a near circle at the wide openings used for low-light shots, spot-light sources have a pleasing circular defocused effect.</li>
<li><strong>Aspherical Lens Elements :</strong>Three aspherical elements correct visual aberrations more effectively across the entire zoom range and help reduce weight.</li>
<li><strong>ED (Extra-low Dispersion) Glass :</strong>Two ED Glass lenses minimize flare and greatly reduce chromatic aberration, giving you sharp, clear shots even at full telephoto extension.</li>
<li><strong>Advisory When Using DT Lenses With Full-Frame (35mm Equivalent) DSLR Cameras :</strong>Sony a (alpha) lenses with the Digital Technology (DT) designation are ideal for use on APS-C size DSLR cameras and are not recommended for use with full frame DSLR camera bodies (such as the DSLR-A900).</li>
</ul>
Long Description:
<p><span>The <strong>Sony DT 18-200mm f/3.5-6.3 Zoom Lens for NEX Camera</strong> is a can-do lens. It is an 11x 27-300mm (35mm equivalent) zoom that can handle everything from wide landscape photos to portraits to sports, action and even wildlife photography with the telephoto up to 300mm. And the results will be brilliant, with ED (Extra-low Dispersion) glass that minimizes flare and greatly reduces chromatic aberration, fast internal focusing, 13 groups and 15 elements (including aspherical elements that correct visual aberrations across the entire zoom range) and a circular aperture for more pleasing out-of-focus areas. This lens is not recommended for use with full-frame DSLRs.</span></p>

Long Description:
<p>The<strong>Sony Cyber-shot DSC-HX200V Digital Camera</strong>puts 18.2Mp, 1080/60p video capture, and the grip and styling of a DSLR in the palm of your hand. Designed for the more active shooter with a need for a better grip than that of a traditional point-and-shoot, the HX200V goes the distance. It works hard to provide you with great looking images and the extensively functionality achieve them.</p>
<p>18.2Mp images just don't happen. An entire system has to come together to make it possible. The HX200V provides you with the tools needed, including Active 3-Way Optical Image Stabilization, a 3.0"" Xtra Fine LCD TruBlack display, and a Carl Zeiss Vario-Tessar 30x optical zoom lens. The lens also utilizes a 60x Clear Image Zoom.</p>
<p>A number of auto modes come into play when shooting the HX200V as well. From GPS and Compass functionality for geo-tagging to iSCN for automatically adjusted camera settings, Sony gave the HX200V a host of features that take the guesswork out of shooting. Additional highlights include 10 fps burst shooting, Background Defocus, and Anti-blink. And of course, no matter what you're shooting, the camera accepts Sony's Memory Stick Duo media as well as SD/SDHC and SDXC memory cards.</p>

SONY NEX-VG20H E18-200MM

Short Description:
The Sony NEX-VG20 Interchangeable Lens HD Handycam Camcorder with 18-200mm Lens is the updated, second generation of the large-sensor Handycam camcorder, featuring an even higher-resolution CMOS chip and new 24p & 60p recording modes at 1920 x 1080 resolution. Like its predecessor, the NEX-VG10, the VG20 has an APS-sized sensor and an E-mount for attaching Sony's growing family of compatible lenses, and so the camcorder enables the shallow depth of field for which DSLR video cameras are so highly prized.
Long Description:
The VG20 comes with a versatile 11x lens (18-200mm – 32.4-360mm equivalent in the 35mm world for video), an f/3.5-6.3 OSS model that is video-optimized to silently autofocus while providing optical image stabilization for potentially shaky shots. Though it shares strengths with DSLRs, the NEX-VG20 also succeeds where those cameras fall short. Physically a camcorder, it's specifically designed for shooting motion video with ease and comfort.

In fact, the ergonomics of this second-generation NEX camcorder are greatly improved. The NEX-VG20 features a new grip and belt design for more comfortable handheld operation. New buttons enable more efficient operation: there are new direct-access hard keys near the rear of the body, an expanded focus button for better manual focus, and a second REC button that's more easily accessible during low-angle shooting, for when you're holding the NEX-VG20 by its pro-style handle.

Of course, the VG20 keeps the features that made its predecessor such a standout. The APS HD CMOS sensor is significantly larger than a conventional camcorder's, and it's large enough to grant you creative control over what's in focus and what's not, facilitating cinematic-looking video. Manual control over all significant image parameters furthers this intimate level of engagement with captured image.

And unlike with DSLR cameras, there's a swiveling LCD screen, to show you what's in the frame as you shoot from any angle – the 3.0"" Xtra Fine LCD now swivels 270°. It's also now a touchscreen, for direct control over menu functions. When the LCD panel is closed, the assignable control dial is now accessible to the operator.

Further enhancements for the NEX-VG20 include the capture of RAW still images (up to the sensor's 16.1 Mp size, of course) and 5.1 surround-sound recording with audio level control. Like the VG10, the NEX-VG20 records AVCHD files (up to 28 Mb/s) to either Memory Stick or SD/SDHC/SDXC cards, and it adds Direct Copy of these files to hard drives.

Interchangeable Lenses
The NEX-VG20 is compatible with Sony's E-mount series of smaller, lighter lenses which are optimized for video shooting with silent-operation auto-focus – as well as Sony/Minolta A-mount lenses (via optional A-mount adapter) to open up a world of creative options. The supplied 18-200mm (11x) lens features 35mm equivalent focal lengths of 32.4-360mm (video) and 27-300mm (photo)
Exmor APS HD CMOS Sensor
This is the same sensor format that Sony builds into the standard-size α DSLRs. With approximately 19.5x the surface area of conventional camcorder sensors, the Exmor APS HD CMOS sensor makes getting cinematic video with a shallow depth of field a breeze
Long-Lasting Battery
The NEX-VG20 uses a V-Series battery, and with the supplied NP-FV70 you get continuous recording time up to 145 minutes
Wide 3.0"" Touchscreen LCD
The camcorder's 3.0"" widescreen Xtra Fine touchscreen LCD (921,000 dots) features TruBlack technology and swivels 270°
Quad-Capsule Microphone
Integrated into the handle of the NEX-VG20, the Quad Capsule Spatial Array Stereo Microphone captures stereo audio, with left and right elements oriented 90° from each other. The camera also captures 5.1-channel surround, and features advanced signal processing and audio level control
Manual Controls
For the ultimate in visual creativity, the NEX-VG20 features manual control not just focus but also iris, shutter speed, gain, and white balance
Optical SteadyShot with Active Mode
Optical SteadyShot image stabilization with Active Mode compensates for greater degrees of camera shake to deliver stunningly smooth video
Up to 28 Mb/s AVCHD Video
The NEX-VG20 can capture video in full 1920 x 1080 high definition at up to 28 Mb/s for amazing clarity and detail, in 24p, 60i, and 60p progressive frame rate modes
HDMI Output for HD Viewing
Enjoy HD movies and stunning still images on a compatible HDTV or HDMI-enabled field monitor via the camera's HDMI output (mini-HDMI-to-HDMI cable not included). The VG20 continues to show live video on its LCD screen even as video is output via HDMI
Media Card Slot
For cost-effective, convenient storage and sharing of your images, the camera accepts Memory Stick PRO Duo and SD/SDHC/SDXC media (Class 4 or higher recommended). (Memory card is required. All are sold separately.)

Long Description:
<p>Electric Avenue introduces the<strong> Sony</strong>wants to introduce you to their<strong>Alpha SLT-A77 DSLR Digital Camera</strong>(Body Only). This DSLR has a number of things going for it, not the least of which is the 24.3Mp sensor. Think of all the possibilities 24.3 megapixels of resolution has: mural sized prints, incredible detail, rich color, and more! If you've been craving the pixel power of the medium format back, but in a DSLR rig, now your wait is over.</p>
<p>Sony also gave the A77 their 2nd generation Translucent Mirror Technology system. What does this technology do? It allows the camera to focus with the speed and accuracy of Phase Detection AF and shoot simultaneously. This is an unheard of capability in the world of digital photography, well until now, that is. The camera also boasts Sony's upgraded BIONZ image processor. The processor performs many functions, including efficiently transferring shot data to the chip in your memory card. It also reduces visual noise, and ensures that functions such as 6-image layering and 2D/3D Sweep Panorama work smoothly, and with the necessary speed.</p>
<p>More than a still camera, the SLT-A77 also captures high-quality 1920 x 1080p AVCHD video at 60p or 24p. You can also choose to record at 60i. HD movies can also be captured with full manual control. That means the entire mode dial is at your disposal: Program, Shutter Priority, Aperture Priority, and Manual. Live View, Full-Time Live View (in LCD or EVF) are also available for use as is Full-Time Phase Detection AF. The latter of course being an intelligent way to correct focus automatically, while you concentrate on the scene at hand.</p>
<p>What the DSLR also offers, above and beyond most less-sophisticated cameras, is a viewfinder, the way all your heroes used to shoot. The A77's OLED viewfinder gets your eye off the LCD screen and into the right situation for capturing successful images. Like all viewfinders, this one keeps distractions and glare at bay. But what the OLED viewfinder does that's above and beyond the pack includes a reduction of motion blur on the Tru-Finder screen. The OLED features 2359K dots of resolution and a high contrast ratio. It also allows you to see the results of camera adjustments in real time with true-to-life color and detail.</p>
<p>Of course, the SLT-A77 does have an LCD screen too, but not just any monitor. This one tilts<em>and</em>swivels for everything from hard-to-get shots to successful reviewing of footage in harsh lighting conditions. What else does this type of LCD allow you to do? How about self-portraits? (We all know you take them... every 'creative' photographer does!) When it's not in use, the screen folds flat to the camera for safe storage and traveling.</p>
<p>As far as shooting performance is concerned, in regards to all things internal on the camera, the A77 backs up those 24.3Mp with the kinds of features and functions one would expect. First, the camera supports burst shooting up to 12 frames per second at full resolution; that's great news for sports photographers. The A77 also boasts a super-short lag time of only 0.05 seconds. Then there's the 16,000 ISO sensitivity and the 1200-zone exposure metering. The metering function reads directly from the camera's main image sensor and offers the choice of Multi, Center, and Spot metering.</p>
<p>As for more proprietary shooting features, the camera has a load of those too! While you can shoot on manual, you might find yourself playing with all the built-in options for expressing your creativity. First off, there's the dual control dials that give you access to two settings at once. All the traditional P/A/S/M exposure modes can be found there. Getting into the menu functions you'll find options such as 19-point Auto Focus, Object Tracking AF, and 6-image layering just to start. Dig a little deeper and Handheld Twilight mode and Multi-Frame NR are there to help you capture excellent low-light images.</p>
<p>There are also find extras such as built-in GPS. The integrated GPS receiver records the location and time of every shot you take, allowing you to view them later on a map with compatible computer and Internet applications. This feature is also great for those into 'geo-tagging'. Eleven Picture Effects modes also give you another way to express yourself with options like Pop Color, Retro Photo, Toy Camera, and more. Old standards like face detection and Sony's Smile Shutter technology are there for your use as well.</p>
<p>Like any good DSLR worth its salt, Sony gave the SLT-A77 a built-in flash for capturing low-light shots with ease. That same flash can also trigger an optional wireless flash. The camera also has an integrated hot shoe for attaching various external flashes and flash accessories (sold separately).</p>

Sony&#39;s Translucent Mirror Technology system is one for starters. This technology allows the camera to both shoot and focus with speed and accuracy by directing light to the image sensor and the Phase Detection AF sensor.

At the heart of the camera, the &#39;Exmor R&#39; CMOS sensor is the center of all the CX360V&#39;s pixel power. Along with the sensor&#39;s ability to provide progressive HD, it&#39;s also back-illuminated, which allows for a high level of low light sensitivity. Basically, the camera boasts excellent low light video.</p><p style=""font-size: 12px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.5em; line-height: 15px; color: rgb(89, 89, 89); font-family: Arial, sans-serif; text-align: left; "">Of course, helping the CX360V shoot all that impressive video and capture stunning stills are the likes of a lens, LCD, and other expected features. This cam has a Wide Angle G lens, a 3.0&quot; touch screen LCD, optical image stabilization, and 17x Extended zoom. Additionally, Dolby Digital 5.1 channel recording helps to capture sound from all directions for all encompassing audio that&#39;s truer to the way you hear sounds in real life.</p><p style=""font-size: 12px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.5em; line-height: 15px; color: rgb(89, 89, 89); font-family: Arial, sans-serif; text-align: left; "">The shooting controls on the camcorder help to take the guesswork out of recording - leaving you free to enjoy the moment, instead of futzing with the camera. Intelligent Auto is just one example of how the CX360V makes recording easier. This feature automatically determines the right combination of settings for your situation. Other highlights of the camera include microphone and headphone jacks, an Active Interface Shoe, and Sony&#39;s Clear Phase stereo speakers for excellent audio even when there is no external microphone attached.</p><div class=""sectionHeaders"" style=""font-size: 12px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; color: rgb(89, 89, 89); font-family: Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 15px; text-align: left; ""><dl style=""border-style: initial; border-color: initial; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-
